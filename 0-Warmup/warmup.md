4. Briefly describe what you want to get out of this class.

Just as Brian Mitchell said in class. This class will be a core class that we carry on the knowledge for a lot of our careers. I hope this class has a lot of real world industry relevance that I can use toward my next job. I've also heard a lot about threading and memory management and know that these are important topics. I really want to understand the material so that it better prepares me for my career.

5. Briefly describe any concerns you might be having with being successful in this class (if any).

My concern with this class is that it is going to be a lot of work. This term I am taking 19 credits and juggling the course work will be a difficult task. My goal is to try and stay on top of all the course work.
